// Called on the main thread immediately after self.view is created.  Best time to add gesture recognizers to the view.

// Called on the main thread by the view's -layoutSubviews.  Layout all subnodes or subviews in this method.
- (void)layout;

// Called on the main thread by the view's -layoutSubviews, after -layout.  Gives a chance for subclasses to perform actions after the subclass and superclass have finished laying out.
- (void)layoutDidFinish;

// Subclasses that override should expect this method to be called on a non-main thread.  The returned size is cached by
// ASDisplayNode for quick access during -layout, via -calculatedSize.  Other expensive work that needs to be done
// before display can be performed here, and using ivars to cache any valuable intermediate results is encouraged.  This
// method should not be called directly outside of ASDisplayNode; use -sizeToFit: or -calculatedSize instead.
- (CGSize)calculateSizeThatFits:(CGSize)constrainedSize;

// Subclasses should call this method to invalidate the previously measured and cached size for the display node, when the contents of
// the node change in such a way as to require measuring it again.
- (void)invalidateCalculatedSize;

// Subclasses should implement -display if the layer's contents will be set directly to an arbitrary buffer (e.g. decoded JPEG).
// Called on a background thread, some time after the view has been created.  This method is called if -drawInContext: is not implemented.

// Returns a UIView, not ASDisplayNode, for two reasons:
// 1) allows sending events to plain UIViews that don't have attached nodes, 2) hitTest: is never called before the views are created.

// Subclasses may override this if they require modifying the scale set on their child nodes.
- (void)recursivelySetNeedsDisplayAtScale:(CGFloat)contentsScale;

// Use setNeedsDisplayAtScale: and then after display, the display node will set the layer's contentsScale. This is to prevent jumps when re-rasterizing at a different contentsScale.
